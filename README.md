# Forth Standard (200x) DocSet

Generate a [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash/) docset with the Forth 200x
Standard.

## Usage and Installation

You can download the docset from the releases section.

If for whatever reason you need to generate the docset from scratch,
clone this repo and execute `make`:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:adolfopa/forth-docset.git
$ cd forth-docset
$ make
```

If everything goes well, you will find the docset inside the `build/`
directory.
